# ChimeraTools

Dash Plotly Dashboard to generate libraries of chimeric proteins and automated analysis of full library sequencing.

For the SCHEMA analysis, this dashboard relies on the SCHEMA scripts from: http://www.cheme.caltech.edu/groups/fha/old_website_2010.6.25/schema-tools/schema-tools-doc.html
To be able to use SCHEMA analysis, make sure Python2.7 is installed (the remainder of this dashboard runs on Python3), and store the SCHEMA scripts in the 'schema-tools' folder, and make sure they are executable.
